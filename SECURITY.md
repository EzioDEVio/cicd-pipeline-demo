# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This section outlines the versions of our project that currently receive security updates. We aim to keep our users safe by patching versions that are widely used and still in maintenance. If your version is not listed below, we strongly encourage upgrading to a supported version.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 2.0.x   | :x:                |
| 1.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.1   | :x:                |

Please note that we will generally support the latest two major versions with security updates. Older versions will be considered on a case-by-case basis depending on the severity of the issue.
